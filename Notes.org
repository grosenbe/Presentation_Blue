* Reasons to work at Blue Origin
** Facinated and excited about space flight since I was a kid
** Technically really interesting work
** I believe it's in the best interest of humanity to become interplanetary, or at least not entirely Earth dwelling; kind of like "backing up the hard drive."
* Reasons not to work at Lockheed
** Not as interested in working for the government (I don't like having to be on classified programs)
** Don't like having to do timecards/bill stuff hourly to the government
** Less interested in making things that kill people (using my powers for evil!)
** Not really interested in working on 20 year old Fortran projects.
* General Questions/observations
** What's re-entry like on new-shepherd?
*** Appears to be fairly mild, since the sub-orbital trajectory is basically straight up, then straight down.
** Charon, then Goddard, then New shepherd, then New Glenn
*** New Armstrong?  Where is that one going to go?  
** New Shepherd 3 is the one that just flew (April 29th) with cargo
** BE-4
*** Fuled by LOX and methane, 550 kips thrust; 7 of them on the New Glenn first stage; these are the big boys.
*** IE, the New Glenn first stage has ~3.5 to 3.8 million pounds of thrust
*** Throttle range from 2400 kN to what?  480 kN?
*** ULA is going to use it on their Vulcan launch vehicle
**** TODO To what extent are they involved?
** BE-3
*** LH2 and LOX fuel
*** New Glenn upper stages will use these (490 kN / 110 kips each)
*** Throttle range from 490 kN down to 89 kN (~18 %)
** Crunchbase actually lists blue origin as a national security company, as well as a solar company

* Presentation
** First 20 minutes of the presentation should be a high level overview of myself -- call it a personal statement.
*** This is where I talk about why I want to go into the space industry
**** Overarching mission is I want the world to benefit from the work I do.  That's why I went into renewable energy, and that's why I want to go into the space industry
**** Might want to mention that our team won the robotics competition
*** Questions I want to answer
**** Why did I choose my schools and degrees?
***** Although UW as actually the first school that I heard back from, I chose San Diego for undergrad because it made more financial sense.
***** USC because it has a highly rated MS program for dynamics and controls
**** Why am I changing jobs?
***** I've always wanted to work in space
** Second 30 minutes is an overview of stuff I did at work.
*** Mechanical Engineer role (SR)
**** Worked on the CDSEP plant performance model, integrating the Rocketdyne and Cobra code. (Fortran)
**** Worked with the PV team on power project development
***** Development of the PV performance model and design tool, and the systems engineering trades it allowed us to do quickly.
***** Development of the CSP performance model/implementation of the smart dispatch logic in Matlab.
***** Worked with the CSP team as well, mostly with Charles.
**** Developed and troubleshot the financial model
***** Although this was a spreadsheet, I ended up learning a bit about project finance and internal return calculation.
*** Systems engineer role (SR)
**** Development of the SR-120 control software (Matlab)
***** Kalman filter development
***** Include some stuff about the "zero" finding logic?
***** Development of the SVS-Vistek and ViewWorks camera interfaces in C#
**** Test campaigns for the SR-120
***** Determination and definition of performance requirements (IE mirror slope and pointing errors)
***** Hands on testing at Sandia
****** Troubleshooting and modifying the AMS software
***** Camera and SPCA network setup 
***** Daily SCRUMS (agile development) and piloting the system with Mark and Roger
***** All of the performance data processing, which I had to automate because the rest of the team started on the SR-96
**** Development of the in-situ/star characterization software
***** Development of the control system interface; changing a relational object database into an object database
*** Describe the transition to MFC
*** Senior Systems Engineer (MFC)
**** Work at the ATB
***** Describe what the ATB is and what it's intended to be
***** Describe the loitering munition sim and the delay problem.
****** Software overlay generation/frame numbers
****** Camera triggering
******* Describe the oscilloscope testing to determine 
******* Display port -> DVI -> HDMI -> VGA -> BNC 5 wire (RGB + HSYNC + VSYNC) -> Alligator clips
****** Show the histogram
**** Work on PAC-3, which is intended to engage and destroy tactical ballistic missiles
***** Most of it is classified
***** Work on a Linux computing cluster on a continuous system
***** Integrating changes to the simulation from both internal, and also from the customer (IE the government), as well as the ground system components (which are from Raytheon).
***** Integration of an older version of the simulation (entirely Fortran/Linux based) and modularizing it into several libraries which the customer can link together.  
***** Builds on Windows or Linux
