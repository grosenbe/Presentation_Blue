* My interests and thoughts on human access to space and space flight in general.  No requirements in formatting or word count -- free writing exercise
* Remember that Jeff Bezos (The company's founder) has said that future generations won't be able to survive on Earth without expanding into other parts of the solar system.
** "The alternative is stasis."
* Human socities will have to stop growing due to environmental and other constraints.
** Not something we may choose to do, but something we must do.
* What could be more exciting than exploring space?  Plenty of inner trekkie quotes that I won't make here.

* Paragraph 1 -- Reasons the space industry would be interesting to work in
** I've been excited about space since I was a kid
** I believe it's humanity's greatest challenge, and it would be an honor to work on it
** Humanity's (at least, this generation's) most challenging endeavor
*** requiring our best efforts in engineering, finance, project management
** We're also on the brink of humanity's greatest adventure.

* Paragraph 2 -- Reasons why I believe it's imperitive for humanity to leave the planet
** Existential disaster reasons -- war, famine, disease, other cataclysmic events that could extinguish all life on earth (GRB, development of malevolent artificial super intelligence)
** More pedestrian reasons, such as simply running out of energy resources.
*** As someone who used to work in the energy industry, I have a pretty good perspective of this.
** As Bezos put it, the alternative for humanity is stasis.  Human societies would have to stop expanding due to environmental and other constraints 

There are several reasons why the space industry and space flight
would be interesting and exciting to work in.  Like many American
youths, I was fascinated by the idea of space travel as a child.  
Space flight is certainly this generation's greatest challenge, and it
would be an honor to work on it.  It will require humanity's best efforts in
engineering, finance, project management, and several other fields.



Space flight is also one of humanity's greatest survival imperitives, for
several reasons.  There are potential cataclysmic events
facing the earth which could potentially eliminate life on the planet.
These include internal threats such as war, famine, and disease, as
well as external threats such as a stray comet or the development of
artificial super intelligence.  There are also more pedestrian
possibilities, such as the consumption of all of the planet's natural
resources.

In the face of these threats, humanity's chance of survival is much
better if we are a space-faring species.  One might think of this as
something like "backing up the hard drive" for the species.  A rare
event which could extinguish life on the planet would not be enough to
extinguish humanity.

Finally, as Jeff Bezos has put it, the alternative to space flight for
humanity is stasis.  In the absence of space flight, human societies
would have to stop expanding due to environmental and other
constraints.  Human history can be viewed through a variety of lenses,
but it is undeniably a story of continued achievement from any perspective.
Stagnation is not in our destiny as a species.
